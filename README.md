# Indian Sign Detector

This is a python project capable of recognizing and converting Indian Sign Language into words in real-time. 

The project uses a model that has been trained on a dataset of sign language gestures to recognize and interpret the gestures made by the user. It is important to have a way to communicate with people who are deaf or hard of hearing, without the need for an interpreter.
